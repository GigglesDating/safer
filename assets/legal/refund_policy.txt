Refund Policy for Safer 

Effective Date: April 19, 2025

At Safer, we prioritize user trust and satisfaction. Our refund policy is designed to be fair, transparent, and aligned with the nature of the services we provide.

1. Subscription Refunds Once a subscription plan has been purchased and activated, refunds are generally not applicable, as the safety features and services are immediately accessible and usable.
However, exceptions may apply in the following cases:

• Duplicate payments due to technical errors.
• Accidental purchases where the user has not accessed or used any service features.
• Failure to deliver the promised service due to technical faults on our end.

For eligible cases, users must submit a refund request within 7 days of the transaction date by contacting us at [support@saferapp.com] with relevant transaction details.

2. Non-Refundable Situations Refunds will not be issued under the following circumstances:

• Change of mind after purchase.
• Misuse or violation of our Terms & Conditions.
• Inability to access the service due to factors beyond Safer's control (e.g., poor network coverage, user device issues).

3. Processing Time If a refund request is approved, the refund will be processed within 7-14 working days via the original payment method.
